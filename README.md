ðŸŽ­ Emotion Detection Using CNN and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces using a Haar Cascade classifier, and predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral, and disgust using a pre-trained deep learning model. The system also displays advisory messages based on the detected emotion to promote emotional well-being.
